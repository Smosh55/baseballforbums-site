      <h1>League Waiver & Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        This page outlines the waiver, assumption of risk, and conduct expectations for all Baseball For Bums participants.
        By registering, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
      </p>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Baseball involves physical contact, hard balls/bats, running, sliding, collisions, and uneven field conditions.
        Participation is voluntary and carries risk of injury.
      </div>

      <h2>1) Assumption of Risk</h2>
      <p>
        I understand that participating in Baseball For Bums league activities (games, practices, warmups, and related events)
        involves inherent risks, including but not limited to: sprains, strains, fractures, concussions, heat illness, cardiac events,
        collisions with players/objects, and injuries caused by bats, balls, and field conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knowingly and voluntarily assume all such risks, whether known or unknown, foreseeable or unforeseeable, arising from my participation.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Waiver and Release of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, I release and hold harmless Baseball For Bums, the league commissioner, league organizers,
        staff, volunteers, sponsors, partners, and field/property owners from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, or causes of action
        arising out of or related to my participation, including claims based on negligence (except to the extent prohibited by law).
      </p>

      <h2>3) Medical Treatment & Emergency Care</h2>
      <p>
        If I am injured or become ill, I authorize league organizers to seek emergency medical treatment on my behalf if I am unable
        to do so. I understand I am responsible for all medical costs and that the league does not provide medical insurance coverage.
      </p>

      <h2>4) Fitness to Participate</h2>
      <p>
        I affirm that I am physically able to participate and that I will not participate in any activity for which I am not medically cleared.
        I understand I should consult a physician if I have any medical concerns.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Sportsmanship, Umpire Authority & Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p>All participants are expected to maintain a respectful, competitive, and safe environment. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No fighting, threats, harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.</li>
        <li>No intentional attempts to injure another player.</li>
        <li>No excessive profanity directed at any player, umpire, or spectator.</li>
        <li>No alcohol or drug impairment during games.</li>
        <li>Follow field rules and respect property (no vandalism).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Umpire Authority:</strong> Umpires have full and final authority over all on-field decisions, including rules interpretations,
        player conduct, and game control. All umpire decisions are final and must be respected at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any arguing, abusive language, or unsportsmanlike conduct toward an umpire may result in immediate ejection.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Commissioner Authority, Ejections & Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        The League Commissioner retains full authority over disciplinary decisions related to player conduct, rule violations,
        safety concerns, and behavior detrimental to the league.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any player ejected from a game will receive an <strong>automatic one (1) game suspension</strong> in addition to removal from the current game.
      </p>

      <p>The Commissioner may impose additional penalties including, but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extended suspensions</li>
        <li>Multi-game suspensions</li>
        <li>Playoff ineligibility</li>
        <li>Season suspension</li>
        <li>Permanent removal from the league</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Disciplinary decisions are final and not subject to appeal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any player removed or suspended due to conduct violations will not be entitled to a refund of league fees.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Scheduling, Rainouts, and League Operations</h2>
      <p>
        Schedules may change due to field availability, weather, or operational needs.
        <strong>Rainout policy:</strong> If a game is rained out, it will be played the following Tuesday.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Media Release</h2>
      <p>
        I grant permission for Baseball For Bums to use photos and videos taken during league activities for league-related promotion
        (social media, website, recaps), unless I notify the league in writing that I opt out.
      </p>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Agreement:</strong> By registering for Baseball For Bums, I acknowledge that I have read, understood, and agree to this waiver
        and code of conduct, and that I am signing it voluntarily.
